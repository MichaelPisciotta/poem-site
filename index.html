        <p>
            Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, <br><br>
            And sorry I could not travel both<br><br>
            And be one traveler, long I stood<br><br>
            And looked down one as far as I could<br><br>
            To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br><br>
            Then took the other, as just as fair,<br><br>
            And having perhaps the better claim<br><br>
            Because it was grassy and wanted wear,<br><br>
            Though as for that the passing there<br><br>
            Had worn them really about the same,<br><br>
            And both that morning equally lay<br><br>
            In leaves no step had trodden black.<br><br>
            Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br><br>
            Yet knowing how way leads on to way<br><br>
            I doubted if I should ever come back.<br><br>
            I shall be telling this with a sigh<br><br>
            Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br><br>
            Two roads diverged in a wood, and I,<br><br>
            I took the one less traveled by,<br><br>
            And that has made all the difference.<br><br>
